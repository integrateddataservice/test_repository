# Notes
- Cloudflare is sometimes lagy (I think). Things that make it worse:
    - after leaving it for a bit them come back
    - going between notebook and terminal in JLab (very lagy)
I sometimes think I've made a mistake and have to wait for the keyboard to catch up, 
- If you leave your laptop for a bit Cloudflare will log you out of GitHub and IDS
- Need to PAT for GitHub, this is created in BI so can't save it anywhere for future use (maybe a good thing?)
